/**
 * The main use of this class is to print a message. It has one field,
 * messageToBePrinted, which has a default value. There is a (default)
 * constructor, whose side effect is to let us know that a new object has been
 * created, and a constructor which takes a string as argument and sets the value
 * of messageToBePrinted equal to that String. We then have a method
 * printMessage(), which just prints the value of messageToBePrinted, and an
 * overloaded method printMessage(String messageViaMethod) which prints messageViaMethod.
