/**
 * The code in this package displays an example of the enum type: it is useful when you have to group together
 * and use a predefined set of constant values (enumerated types, typically strings).
 * In Currency we create five String values, which represent currencies.
 * You can think about a specific enum type as a class which has some useful, pre-implemented methods like ordinal(),
 * to indicate the declaration order of a particular enum constant, and values(), a method that produces
 * an array of values of the enum constant in the order they are declared.
