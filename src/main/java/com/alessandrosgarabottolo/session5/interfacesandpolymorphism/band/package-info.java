/**
 * In this package we show another example of polymorphism, connected with interfaces. An enum type
 * is also used. Here the interface Instrument is implemented by the classes Wind, Percussion and
 * Woodwind, which extends Wind. In the class Band, the method tune accepts a reference of type
 * Instrument: polymorphism.
